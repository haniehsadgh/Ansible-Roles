# Ansible-Roles
demo application

Sorry I missed the part for the ansible - so i recorded a very short video with the link: https://youtu.be/B6sd5_4ppdE

**after downloading the zip file, Haniehsadat_gholamhosseini_as2.zip:**
- in the main.tf inside the zip folder - comment the bucket configurations inside the terraform block on the top main.tf

as3 directory acts as terraform directory and as3-files-4640-w24 acts as my ansible directory

- run 'terraform init' to Prepare your working directory for other commands - so the backend.tf creates the s3 bucket and the dynamodb table to be prepred for the block that we just commented 
- uncomment the bucket configuration inside the main.tf  file in order to use AWS S3 for storing Terraform state files.
- run "terraform init"  in your terminal or command prompt to initialize Terraform
- it asks for a permission - if its ok to move the tv state from writing it , type yes
- run 'terraform apply' to  Create infrastructure (this will take a few minutes)

Once completed, clone the appliaction repository (https://gitlab.com/cit_4640/as3-files-4640-w24)
I treated  "as3-files-4640-w24" directory as my ansible - where my hosts.yml and ansible.config will be created in
When Apply complete, will output ec2 instances public ip
You should have hosts.yaml and ansible.config generated by terraform in the as3-files-4640-w24 directory located in same directory as main.tf.

- run cd '4640-assignment-app-files' where the application files and playbook are
- run 'ansible-playbook playbook.yml' to  Run Ansible Playbook against the Infrastructure you just created

Once completed, do testing as instrcuction says in the README.md in the git repository as cloned in the same directory as main.tf in as3 directory
